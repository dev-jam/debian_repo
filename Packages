 .
 `fclones` is a command line utility that identifies groups of identical files
 and gets rid
 of the file copies you no longer need. It comes with plenty of configuration
 options for controlling
 the search scope and offers many ways of removing duplicates. For maximum
 flexibility,
 it integrates well with other Unix utilities like `find` and it speaks JSON, so
 you have a lot
 of control over the search and cleanup process.
 .
 `fclones` treats your data seriously. You can inspect and modify the list of
 duplicate files before removing them.
 There is also a `--dry-run` option that can tell you exactly what changes on
 the file system would be made.
 .
 `fclones` has been implemented in Rust with a strong focus on high performance
 on modern hardware.
 It employs several optimization techniques not present in many other programs.
 It adapts to the type of the hard drive, orders file operations by physical
 data placement on HDDs,
 scans directory tree in parallel and uses prefix compression of paths to reduce
 memory consumption when working
 with millions of files. It is also friendly to page-cache and does not push out
 your data out of cache.
 As a result, `fclones` easily outperforms many other popular duplicate finders
 by a wide margin
 on either SSD or HDD storage.
 .
 `fclones` is available on a wide variety of operating systems, but it works
 best on Linux.

   - finding files with more than N replicas
   - finding unique files
   - finding files with fewer than N replicas
 * Advanced file selection for reducing the amount of data to process
   - scanning multiple directory roots
   - can work with a list of files piped directly from standard input
   - recursive/non-recursive file selection
   - recursion depth limit
   - filtering names and paths by extended UNIX globs

 .
 ### Limitations
 Copy-on-write file data deduplication (reflink) is not supported on Windows.
 .
 Some optimisations are not available on platforms other than Linux:
   - ordering of file accesses by physical placement
   - page-cache drop-behind
 .
 ## Demo
 Let's first create some files:
 .
     $ mkdir test
     $ cd test
     $ echo foo >foo1.txt
     $ echo foo >foo2.txt
     $ echo foo >foo3.txt
     $ echo bar >bar1.txt
     $ echo bar >bar2.txt
 .
 Now let's identify the duplicates:
 .
     $ fclones group . >dupes.txt
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.358] fclones:  info: Started grouping
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.738] fclones:  info: Scanned 7 file entries
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.738] fclones:  info: Found 5 (20 B) files matching
 selection criteria
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.738] fclones:  info: Found 4 (16 B) candidates after
 grouping by size
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.738] fclones:  info: Found 4 (16 B) candidates after
 grouping by paths and file identifiers
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.739] fclones:  info: Found 3 (12 B) candidates after
 grouping by prefix
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.740] fclones:  info: Found 3 (12 B) candidates after
 grouping by suffix
     [2021-06-05 18:21:33.741] fclones:  info: Found 3 (12 B) redundant files
 .
     $ cat dupes.txt
     # Report by fclones 0.12.0
     # Timestamp: 2021-06-05 18:21:33.741 +0200
     # Command: fclones group .
     # Found 2 file groups
     # 12 B (12 B) in 3 redundant files can be removed
     7d6ebf613bf94dfd976d169ff6ae02c3, 4 B (4 B) * 2:
         /tmp/test/bar1.txt
         /tmp/test/bar2.txt
     6109f093b3fd5eb1060989c990d1226f, 4 B (4 B) * 3:
         /tmp/test/foo1.txt
         /tmp/test/foo2.txt
         /tmp/test/foo3.txt
 .
 Finally we can replace the duplicates by soft links:
 .
     $ fclones link --soft <dupes.txt
     [2021-06-05 18:25:42.488] fclones:  info: Started deduplicating
     [2021-06-05 18:25:42.493] fclones:  info: Processed 3 files and reclaimed
 12 B space
 .
     $ ls -l
     total 12
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk   4 cze  5 18:19 bar1.txt
     lrwxrwxrwx 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk  18 cze  5 18:25 bar2.txt ->
 /tmp/test/bar1.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk 382 cze  5 18:21 dupes.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk   4 cze  5 18:19 foo1.txt
     lrwxrwxrwx 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk  18 cze  5 18:25 foo2.txt ->

     lrwxrwxrwx 1 pkolaczk pkolaczk  18 cze  5 18:25 foo3.txt ->
 /tmp/test/foo1.txt
 .

 ## Usage
 .
 `fclones` offers separate commands for finding and removing files. This way,
 you can inspect
 the list of found files before applying any modifications to the file system.
 .
   - `group` ‚Äì identifies groups of identical files and prints them to the
 standard output
   - `remove` ‚Äì removes redundant files earlier identified by `group`
   - `link` ‚Äì replaces redundant files with links (default: hard links)
   - `dedupe` ‚Äì does not remove any files, but deduplicates file data by using
 native copy-on-write capabilities of the file system (reflink)
 .
 ### Finding Files
 .
 Find duplicate, unique, under-replicated or over-replicated files in the
 current directory,
 including subdirectories:
 .
     fclones group .
     fclones group . --unique
     fclones group . --rf-under 3
     fclones group . --rf-over 3
 .
 You can search in multiple directories:
 .
     fclones group dir1 dir2 dir3
 .
 By default, hidden files and files matching patterns listed in `.gitignore` and
 `.fdignore` are
 ignored. To search all files, use:
 .
     fclones group --no-ignore --hidden dir
 .
 Limit the recursion depth:
 .
     fclones group . --depth 1   # scan only files in the current dir, skip
 subdirs
     fclones group * --depth 0   # similar as above in shells that expand `*`
 .
 Caution: Versions up to 0.10 did not descend into directories by default.
 In those old versions, add `-R` flag to enable recursive directory walking.
 .
 Finding files that match across two directory trees, without matching identical
 files
 within each tree:
 .
     fclones group --isolate dir1 dir2
 .
 Finding duplicate files of size at least 100 MB:
 .
     fclones group . -s 100M
 .
 Filter by file name or path pattern:
 .
     fclones group . --name '*.jpg' '*.png'
 .
 Run `fclones` on files selected by `find` (note: this is likely slower than
 built-in filtering):
 .
     find . -name '*.c' | fclones group --stdin --depth 0
 .
 Follow symbolic links, but don't escape out of the home folder:
 .
     fclones group . -L --path '/home/**'
 .
 Exclude a part of the directory tree from the scan:
 .
     fclones group / --exclude '/dev/**' '/proc/**'
 .
 ### Removing Files
 To remove duplicate files, move them to a different place or replace them by
 links,
 you need to send the report produced by `fclones group` to the standard input
 of `fclones remove`, `fclones move` or `fclones link` command.
 The report format is detected automatically. Currently, `default` and `json`
 report
 formats are supported.
 .
 Assuming the list of duplicates has been saved in file `dupes.txt`, the
 following commands would remove
 the redundant files:
 .
     fclones link <dupes.txt             # replace with hard links
     fclones link -s <dupes.txt          # replace with symbolic links
     fclones move target_dir <dupes.txt  # move to target_dir
     fclones remove <dupes.txt           # remove totally
 .
 .
 If you prefer to do everything at once without storing the list of groups in a
 file, you can pipe:
 .
     fclones group . | fclones link
 .
 To select the number of files to preserve, use the `-n`/`--rf-over` option.
 By default, it is set to the value used when running `group` (which is 1 if it
 wasn't set explicitly).
 To leave 2 replicas in each group, run:
 .
     fclones remove -n 2 <dupes.txt
 .
 By default, `fclones` follows the order of files specified in the input file.
 It keeps the files given at the beginning
 of each list, and removes / replaces the files given at the end of each list.
 It is possible to change that
 order by `--priority` option, for example:
 .
     fclones remove --priority newest <dupes.txt        # remove the newest
 replicas
     fclones remove --priority oldest <dupes.txt        # remove the oldest
 replicas
 .
 For more priority options, see `fclones remove --help`.
 .
 It is also possible to restrict removing files to only files with names or
 paths matching a pattern:
 .
     fclones remove --name '*.jpg' <dupes.txt       # remove only jpg files
     fclones remove --path '/trash/**' <dupes.txt   # remove only files in the
 /trash folder
 .
 If it is easier to specify a pattern for files which you do *not* want to
 remove, then use one of `keep` options:
 .
     fclones remove --keep-name '*.mov' <dupes.txt           # never remove mov
 files
     fclones remove --keep-path '/important/**' <dupes.txt   # never remove
 files in the /important folder
 .
 To make sure you're not going to remove wrong files accidentally, use
 `--dry-run` option.
 This option prints all the commands that would be executed, but it doesn't
 actually execute them:
 .
     fclones link --soft <dupes.txt --dry-run 2>/dev/null
 .
     mv /tmp/test/bar2.txt /tmp/test/bar2.txt.jkXswbsDxhqItPeOfCXsWN4d
     ln -s /tmp/test/bar1.txt /tmp/test/bar2.txt
     rm /tmp/test/bar2.txt.jkXswbsDxhqItPeOfCXsWN4d
     mv /tmp/test/foo2.txt /tmp/test/foo2.txt.ze1hvhNjfre618TkRGUxJNzx
     ln -s /tmp/test/foo1.txt /tmp/test/foo2.txt
     rm /tmp/test/foo2.txt.ze1hvhNjfre618TkRGUxJNzx
     mv /tmp/test/foo3.txt /tmp/test/foo3.txt.ttLAWO6YckczL1LXEsHfcEau
     ln -s /tmp/test/foo1.txt /tmp/test/foo3.txt
     rm /tmp/test/foo3.txt.ttLAWO6YckczL1LXEsHfcEau
 .
 ### Handling links
 Files linked by symbolic links or hard links are not treated as duplicates.
 You can change this behavior by setting the following flags:
  * When `--isolate` is set:
    * links residing in different directory trees are treated as duplicates,
    * links residing in the same directory tree are counted as a single replica.
  * When `--match-links` is set, fclones treats all linked files as duplicates.
 .
 Consider the following directory structure, where all files are hard links
 sharing the same content:
 .
     dir1:
       - file1
       - file2
     dir2:
       - file3
       - file4
 .
 Because all files are essentially the same data, they will end up in the same
 file group, but
 the actual number of replicas present in that file group will differ depending
 on the flags given:
 .
 | Command                                 | Number of replicas | Group reported
   | Files to remove     |
 |-----------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|
 | `fclones group dir1 dir2`               | 1                  | No
   |                     |
 | `fclones group dir1 dir2 --isolate`     | 2                  | Yes
   | file3, file4        |
 | `fclones group dir1 dir2 --match-links` | 4                  | Yes
   | file2, file3, file4 |
 .
 #### Symbolic links
 The `group` command ignores symbolic links to files unless at least
 `--follow-links`
 or `--symbolic-links` flag is set. If only `--follow-links` is set, symbolic
 links to files
 are followed and resolved to their targets.
 If `--symbolic-links` is set, symbolic links to files are not followed,
 but treated as hard links and potentially reported in the output report.
 When both `--symbolic-links` and `--follow-links` are set, symbolic links to
 directories are followed,
 but symbolic links to files are treated as hard links.
 .
 **Caution**: Using `--match-links` together with `--symbolic-links` is very
 dangerous.
 It is easy to end up deleting the only regular file you have, and to be left
 with a bunch of orphan symbolic links.
 .
 ### Preprocessing Files
 Use `--transform` option to safely transform files by an external command.
 By default, the transformation happens on a copy of file data, to avoid
 accidental data loss.
 Note that this option may significantly slow down processing of a huge number
 of files,
 because it invokes the external program for each file.
 .
 The following command will strip exif before matching duplicate jpg images:
 .
     fclones group . --name '*.jpg' -i --transform 'exiv2 -d a $IN' --in-place
 .
 .

     fclones [command] --help  # detailed help
 .
 ### Path Globbing
 `fclones` understands a subset of Bash Extended Globbing.
 The following wildcards can be used:
 - `?`         matches any character except the directory separator
 - `[a-z]`     matches one of the characters or character ranges given in the
 square brackets
 - `[!a-z]`    matches any character that is not given in the square brackets
 - `*`         matches any sequence of characters except the directory separator
 - `**`        matches any sequence of characters including the directory
 separator
 - `{a,b}`     matches exactly one pattern from the comma-separated patterns
 given inside the curly brackets
 - `@(a|b)`    same as `{a,b}`
 - `?(a|b)`    matches at most one occurrence of the pattern inside the brackets
 - `+(a|b)`    matches at least occurrence of the patterns given inside the
 brackets
 - `*(a|b)`    matches any number of occurrences of the patterns given inside
 the brackets
 - `\`         escapes wildcards on Unix-like systems, e.g. `\?` would match `?`
 literally
 - `^`         escapes wildcards on Windows, e.g. `^?` would match `?` literally
 .
 #### Caution
 .
 * On Unix-like systems, when using globs, one must be very careful to avoid
 accidental expansion of globs by the shell.
   In many cases having globs expanded by the shell instead of by `fclones` is
 not what you want. In such cases, you
   need to quote the globs:
 .
       fclones group . --name '*.jpg'
 .
 * On Windows, the default shell doesn't remove quotes before passing the
 arguments to the program,
   therefore you need to pass globs unquoted:
 .
       fclones group . --name *.jpg
 .
 * On Windows, the default shell doesn't support path globbing, therefore
 wildcard characters such as * and ? used
   in paths will be passed literally, and they are likely to create invalid
 paths. For example, the following
   command that searches for duplicate files in the current directory in Bash,
 will likely fail in the default
   Windows shell:
 .
       fclones group *
 .
   If you need path globbing, and your shell does not support it,
   use the builtin path globbing provided by `--name` or `--path`.
 .
 ## The Algorithm
 Files are processed in several stages. Each stage except the last one is
 parallel, but
 the previous stage must complete fully before the next one is started.
 1. Scan input files and filter files matching the selection criteria. Walk
 directories recursively if requested.
    Follow symbolic links if requested. For files that match the selection
 criteria, read their size.
 2. Group collected files by size by storing them in a hash-map. Remove groups
 smaller than the desired lower-bound
    (default 2).
 3. In each group, remove duplicate files with the same inode id. The same file
 could be reached through different
    paths when hardlinks are present. This step can be optionally skipped.
 4. For each remaining file, compute a hash of a tiny block of initial data. Put
 files with different hashes
    into separate groups. Prune result groups if needed.
 5. For each remaining file, compute a hash of a tiny block of data at the end
 of the file.
    Put files with different hashes into separate groups. Prune small groups if
 needed.
 6. For each remaining file, compute a hash of the whole contents of the file.
 Note that for small files
    we might have already computed a full contents hash in step 4, therefore
 these files can be safely
    omitted. Same as in steps 4 and 5, split groups and remove the ones that are
 too small.
 7. Write report to the stdout.
 .
 Note that there is no byte-by-byte comparison of files anywhere. All available
 hash functions are at least
 128-bit wide, and you don't need to worry about hash collisions. At
 10<sup>15</sup> files,
 the probability of collision is 0.000000001 when using a 128-bit hash,
 without taking into account the requirement for the files to also match by
 size.
 .
 ### Hashes
 You can select the hash function with `--hash-fn` (default: `metro`).
 Non-cryptographic hashes are much more efficient than cryptographic,
 however you probably won't see much difference unless you're reading from a
 fast SSD or if file data is cached.
 .
 | Hash function                                               | Hash width |
 Cryptographic |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
 | [metro](http://www.jandrewrogers.com/2015/05/27/metrohash/) | 128-bit    | No
            |
 | [xxhash3](https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/)               | 128-bit    | No
            |
 | [blake3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3)             | 256-bit    |
 Yes           |
 | [sha256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)               | 256-bit    |

 | [sha512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)               | 512-bit    |
 Yes           |
 | [sha3-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)             | 256-bit    |

 | [sha3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)             | 512-bit    |
 Yes           |
 .
 ## Tuning
 This section provides hints on getting the best performance from `fclones`.
 .
 ### Incremental Mode
 If you expect to run `fclones group` more than once on the same set of files,
 you might benefit from turning on the hash cache by adding the `--cache` flag:
 .
 ```
 fclones group --cache <dir>
 ```
 .
 Caching can dramatically improve grouping speed on subsequent runs of `fclones`
 at the expense of some additional
 storage space needed for the cache. Caching also allows for resuming work
 quickly after interruption, so it is
 recommended if you plan to run `fclones` on huge data sets.
 .
 The cache works as follows:
 - Each newly computed file hash is persisted in the cache together with some
 metadata of the file such as
   its modification timestamp and length.
 - Whenever a file hash needs to be computed, it is first looked up in the
 cache.
   The cached hash is used if the current metadata of the file strictly matches
 the metadata stored in the cache.
 .
 Cached hashes are not invalidated by file moves because files are identified
 by their internal identifiers (inode identifiers on Unix), not by path names,
 and moves/renames typically preserve
 those.
 .
 Beware that caching relies on file metadata to detect changes in file contents.
 This might introduce some inaccuracies to the grouping process if a file
 modification timestamp and file length
 is not updated immediately whenever a file gets modified.
 Most file systems update the timestamps automatically on closing the file.
 Therefore, changed files that are held
 open for a long time (e.g. by database systems) might be not noticed by
 `fclones group` and might use stale
 cached values.
 .
 The cache database is located in the standard cache directory of the user
 account. Typically, those are:
 * Linux: `$HOME/.cache/fclones`
 * macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/fclones`
 * Windows: `$HOME/AppData/Local/fclones`
 .
 ### Configuring Parallelism
 The `--threads` parameter controls the sizes of the internal thread-pool(s).
 This can be used to reduce parallelism level when you don't want `fclones` to
 impact performance of your system too much, e.g. when you need to do some other
 work
 at the same time. We recommended reducing the parallelism level if you need
 to reduce memory usage.
 .
 When using `fclones` up to version 0.6.x to deduplicate files of sizes of at
 least a few MBs each
 on spinning drives (HDD), it is recommended to set `--threads 1`, because
 accessing big files
 from multiple threads on HDD can be much slower than single-threaded access
 (YMMV, this is heavily OS-dependent, 2x-10x performance differences have been
 reported).
 .
 Since version 0.7.0, fclones uses separate per-device thread-pools for final
 hashing
 and it will automatically tune the level of parallelism, memory buffer sizes
 and partial hashing sizes
 based on the device type. These automatic settings can be overridden with
 `-threads` as well.
 .
 The following options can be passed to `--threads`. The more specific options
 override the less specific ones.
 - `main:<n>` ‚Äì sets the size of the main thread-pool used for random I/O:
 directory tree scanning,
    file metadata fetching and in-memory sorting/hashing.
    These operations typically benefit from high parallelism level, even on
 spinning drives.
    Unset by default, which means the pool will be configured to use all
 available CPU cores.
 - `dev:<device>:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì sets the size of the thread-pool `r` used for
 random I/O and `s` used for
    sequential I/O on the block device with the given name. The name of the
 device is OS-dependent.
    Note this is not the same as the partition name or mount point.
 - `ssd:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì sets the sizes of the thread-pools used for I/O on
 solid-state drives. Unset by default.
 - `hdd:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì sets the sizes of the thread-pools used for I/O on spinning
 drives.
    Defaults to `8,1`
 - `removable:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì  sets the size of the thread-pools used for I/O
    on removable devices (e.g. USB sticks). Defaults to `4,1`
 - `unknown:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì  sets the size of the thread-pools used for I/O on
 devices of unknown type.
    Sometimes the device type can't be determined e.g. if it is mounted as NAS.
    Defaults to `4,1`
 - `default:<r>,<s>` ‚Äì sets the pool sizes to be used by all unset options
 - `<r>,<s>` - same as `default:<r>,<s>`
 - `<n>` - same as `default:<n>,<n>`
 .
 ### Examples
 To limit the parallelism level for the main thread pool to 1:
 .
     fclones group <paths> --threads main:1
 .
 To limit the parallelism level for all I/O access for all SSD devices:
 .
     fclones group <paths> --threads ssd:1
 .
 To set the parallelism level to the number of cores for random I/O access and
 to
 2 for sequential I/O access for `/dev/sda` block device:
 .
     fclones group <paths> --threads dev:/dev/sda:0,2
 .
 Multiple `--threads` options can be given, separated by spaces:
 .
     fclones group <paths> --threads main:16 ssd:4 hdd:1,1
 .
 .
 ## Benchmarks
 Different duplicate finders were given a task to find duplicates in a large set
 of files.
 Before each run, the system page cache was evicted with `echo 3 >
 /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`.

   - filtering names and paths by extended UNIX globs
   - filtering by min/max file size
   - proper handling of symlinks and hardlinks
   - optional ignoring of files specified in `.gitignore`
 .
 * Removing redundant data
   - removing, moving or replacing selected files with soft or hard links
   - removing redundant file data using native copy-on-write (reflink) support
 on some file systems
   - bulk selection of files to remove
   - prioritizing files to remove by creation, modification, last access time or
 nesting level
 .
 * High performance
   - parallel processing capability in all I/O and CPU heavy stages
   - automatic tuning of parallelism and access strategy based on device type
 (SSD vs HDD)
   - low memory footprint thanks to heavily optimized path representation
   - doesn't push data out of the page-cache
   - accurate progress reporting
   - uses modern GTK4 list controls that can display hundreds thousands file
 items
 .
 ## Installation
 ### Packages
 .
 Fclones is available in Snap Store:
 .
 ```shell
 snap install fclones-gui
 ```
 .
 There are also binary packages attached to each
 [release](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones-gui/releases/latest).
 .
 ### Building from Source
 Assuming you have Rust toolchain, run the following commands:
 .
 ```shell
 sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev
 cargo install fclones-gui
 ```
 .
 ## Usage
 Should be self-explanatory. If it is not, then let me know by opening issues.
 ;)
 .
 Nevertheless, the workflow is as follows:
 .
 1. Select / add the directories you want to scan for duplicates.
 2. Adjust options if needed.
 3. Press the "Find duplicates" button.
 4. After search is complete, a list of file groups will be displayed.
 5. Select files you want to get rid of.
 6. Select how you want to get rid of them, using the dropdown at the red
 button.
 7. Press the red button (warning: this *is* a destructive action).
 .
 You can remove duplicates many times without rerunning the search.
 You can also go back to the input page and modify your scan settings.
 .
 ## Reporting issues
 Please report issues in GitHub Issues.
 Don't forget to specify your OS and GTK4 version.
 I've run into several GTK4 bugs while working with this project.

Description: GUI to clone and manage Live-Build USB sticks
 This application allows one to make bootable USB sticks from an
 iso-hybrid image issued by Live-Build. It adapts additionally a
 persistence partition to use the free space on the USB stick.
 .
 It features also management tools for live USB sticks: when such
 USB disks are used daily, they happen to have inconsistencies in their
 persistence area which can render them unusable. Tools are provided to
 save persistence data when necessary, and to blank the persistence area,
 so the USB disk can be used again.
 .
 The application detects when it is run from a Debian-Live environment,
 thus featuring seamless auto-cloning.

Description: An Automated, Open-Source Testing Framework
 The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for the Linux operating system. This software is designed to effectively carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean, reproducible, and easy-to-use manner.  The Phoronix Test Suite consists of a lightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark consisting of an XML-based profile with related resource scripts. The process from the benchmark installation, to the actual benchmarking, to the parsing of important hardware and software components is heavily automated and completely repeatable, asking users only for confirmation of actions.  The Phoronix Test Suite integrates with OpenBenchmarking.org for managing of test profiles and suites, optional collaborative results sharing and comparisons, and other cloud-based functionality.
